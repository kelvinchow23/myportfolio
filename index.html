				<h3 class="mb-2">Can you fit a laptop into your pocket? </h3>
				</div>
					<p>Moore's law drives technological advancement to make electronics smaller, true for most cases.  Yet, the cellphone, arguably the most pervasive electronic device, defies this trend.  Why is this?  One reason is the trade-off between convenience and practicality.  People would rather carry around a lightweight phone in their pocket.  Most people also want large electronic displays, which offer more utility.  The electronic display is the geometric constraint of cell phones, tablets, and laptops.  A device with a reconfigurable display would maximize the convenience and utility benefit of electronic devices.</p>
					<p>The general approach in this research field is to place rigid LEDs on soft flexible, stretchable substrates (see figure below).  The key issue with this approach is once the substrate is stretched, the pixel density decreases, reducing the image quality. Also, this approach is dependent on the substrate's mechanical properties, which diminish when stretched.  This project proposes a different approach to this problem. </p>

				<h2 class="mx-auto mb-3">The Initial Design </h2>
				</div>
					<p>The first design proposed a solution where 16 individual square "islands", each representing an LED, would be constrained to move uniformly.  Each island was constrained to move linearly on a track and connected to other islands via guide arms.  By moving one island, all islands would move simultaneously.</p>
					<p> Two major problems of this design forced a redesign.  First, this design required extra space in order to work, defeating the purpose of having a compact design.  Second, this design shared the same flaw as the flexible substrate design. Gaps are created when the islands are in "stretched" state, reducing the pixel density. </p>

				<h2>Balance Rehabilitation Game </h2>
				<h3 class="mb-2">Tagline</h3>
				</div>
				<p>Individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries (SCI) often have balance instability caused by a reduced neural control of lower-limbed muscles.  Rehabilitation tools have been demonstrated to be effective in repairing the disconnect between brain and body.  Two rehabilitation tools of interest are visual feedback training (VFT) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) therapy.  </p>

						<p>An individual is asked to stand on the force plate with their eyes closed as still as possible for 100 seconds. During this time, a centre of position (COP) time series will record and track the involuntary sway of the individual.  For these studies, three performance indicators are taken: root means squared in the (1) anterior-posterior (front to back) and (2) medial-lateral (side to side) direction, and (3) 95% confidence ellipse of the data.</p>

					<p>One problem was the clustering of game scores for some games (the y-axis ranges for the ellipse and colour matching games are lower). This made it difficult to distinguish an individual's balance ability with game scores. Immediately after the trial run, this problem was addressed by changing the scoring system to favour individuals who could keep their balance position closer to the centre of the game targets.</p> 
					<p>The next step would be to conduct another trial run on able-bodied participants, this time incorporating functional electrical stimulation with visual feedback training.  Once done and further system optimizations are performed, the system would be used for clinical trials on individuals with spinal cord injuries to determine the effectiveness of this rehabilitation tool.</p>

					<p>Microfluidics is the manipulation of fluids at low volumes in devices with micron-level dimensions. This field of study has become increasingly popular, especially in biological applications.  In general, the advantages of microfluidics includes its quick, cheap, and simple manufacturing process, the ability to scale designs for high-throughput studies, and its increased measurement accuracy due to the increased area-to-volume ratio. Related to biology, microfluidic devices are typically bio-compatible, and the small volumes are advantageous since many bio-samples are expensive and often difficult to extract at large quantities. </p>
					<p>Bioprinting is the technology intertwining 3D printing and biology. Bio-printers range in capabilities, with some focusing on biocompatible materials that can be used for implantation while others deposit bio-inks containing living cells.  Bio-printing is a promising technology with its potential applications in personalized healthcare.</p>
					<p>At the Guenther lab at the University of Toronto, one research focus is developing microfluidic bioprinting technologies for tissue engineering.  As most of my work is currently in progress and unpublished, it will not be disclosed in this portfolio. I will instead highlight some smaller microfluidic projects and its potential applications in another field.

					<p>Molecular gastronomy is where food meets science to flip traditional culinary practices.  With the same ingredients, the perception of taste can be altered using molecular gastronomy.  Here, we focus on using microfluidics to generate microscale edibles. (Please be prepared to exercise some level of imagination.)</p>
					<p>3 different manufacturing techniques to create 3 different microfluidic devices to create 3 different dishes will be described. The manufacturing process flow to create the devices are similar. All 3 devices are flow-focusing devices with two solutions: sodium alginate and calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The gelation of alginate depends on the ionic reaction between sodium alginate and calcium ions, which creates edible, tastless calcium alginate gels. All devices contain a junction where alginate-filled channel is sandwiched in between two CaCl<sub>2</sub>-filled channels.  By controlling the flowrate ratios, the dimensions of the produced gels can be tuned.

						<h5>1) Mould Design</h5>
						<img src="./img/microfluidics and bioprinting/device design.png" class="img-fluid" style="height:9rem" align="left"></img>
						<p>The first step is design.  A reusable mould is typically involved to make multiple devices, so the design is often of the mould instead of the final device.  Here, a 3-layer microfluidic device is shown.  The top and bottom layers are hot embossed, while the middle layer contains lasercut through holes to connect between layers.  The black holes are through holes, the green patterns are alginate channels, and the light blue patterns are CaCl<sub>2</sub> channels.  The centre through holes on the top and bottom layer are for the fluidic inlets.  Fluid flows from the centre of the device and exits at the 16 outlets at the perimeter.</p>

(b) An epoxy-based resin is poured onto the master and fills in the cavities. (c) After setting, the stiff elastomeric epoxy is removed from the master and the epoxy mould is created.</p>

				<h2>Vehicular Rear-View Camera System </h2>
				<h3 class="mb-4">Looking forward to looking backwards </h3>
				</div>
				<p>Vehicles come in all sorts of shapes and sizes from luxury cars to common sedans, from hybrids to vintage cars, or from trucks to Smart cars. While the rest of the vehicle has morphed to fit modern times, the wing mirror design has stagnated and looks more or less the same on most vehicles (see vehicles below).  Over time, there have been incremental design changes to the side mirror and a drastic overhaul is necessary since the wing mirror is a major design flaw.</p>  
				<p>First, the wing mirror is a safety hazard.  It creates blindspot zones, which has made it standard procedure for drivers to keep their head on a 180° swivel to perform blindspot checks before changing lanes. This flaw has existed for over a century and has never been fully addressed.  At fast speeds, fractions of a a second can be the difference between life or death. The safest option is for drivers to always keep their eyes on the road in front of them.  Second, the wing mirror is the only part of the vehicle that unexpectedly extrudes out from the body of the car.  Although relatively small, this obtrusion can cause up to 7% of total vehicle drag during driving.  </p>
				<p class="mb-5">Automakers are pushing to eliminate the law requiring vehicles to have these anachronistic wing mirrors. This project previews the future of wing mirror-less vehicles.</p>

					<p class="col-5">Due to the scope of the project, the system was designed around an off-the-shelf Raspberry Pi camera board, serving as the geometric constraint for our module. To not further increase the size of our system, a custom PCB was fabricated and placed over the camera board.  The PCB includes high power infrared (IR) LEDs for night time viewing, heater connections for de-icing, a temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor.</p>

Yet, in our camera view, the passing car is still in frame and only leaves the frame when the car has fully overtaken our vehicle.  Thus, our camera eliminates the blindspot of cars in the adjacent lane.</p>

The left is our camera with the infrared LED turned on, and the right is the camera with the light off.  The right view is similar to the view of the side mirror.  It is clear from these videos that the IR LED improves visibility at night.  When the car enters the section without streetlights (or any other external light), the IR LED allows the camera to pick up the lane markings on the road.  In comparison, the side mirror would have shown a pitch black view, demonstrating how dependent drivers currently are on external sources of light. This camera module allows the driver see potential vehicles with their headlights off (or moose, bears, zebras, kangaroos, or camels) that sneak up on us.</p>

With the monitor placed in front of the driver, we demonstrated a driving experience without having to tilt your head to check blindspots.</p>
					<p> Due to the limitations of time and money, the project was narrowed down to a manageable scope, demonstrating a few key concepts. Ideally, we would have put an emphasis on seamlessly integrating the monitors into the vehicle's dashboard to improve the driving experience.  Another emphasis that was briefly covered was the integration of safety features using object detection. There are numerous other ways in which technology can be used to improve our driving experience, so why not use it?</p>
